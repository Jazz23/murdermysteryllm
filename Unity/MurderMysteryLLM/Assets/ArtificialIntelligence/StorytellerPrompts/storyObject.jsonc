            "description": "Elias Vexley is an empathetic and perceptive counselor with a calming presence, making those in distress feel truly heard. Though he remains composed, the emotional toll lingers in his tired yet kind eyes. A quiet observer, he prefers solitude with books on psychology and philosophy. His sharp intuition allows him to sense when someone is withholding the truth—a skill that serves him well on and off the hotline."

            "description": "Raul Alvaros has been the owner and sole optometrist in his small town for the last 30 years. Often seen as the grumpy eye doctor by everyone, he has made a life for himself, having gone through two marriages, raised three kids, and is expecting a grandchild in the fall. He’s a hard worker and hopes to retire the sooner, the better with his current wife in the beaches of  Miami. Though he hopes his gambling doesn’t catch up with him, as he has a bad temper when it comes to losing bets."
