  "description": "Beatrice Langford was once the star of London's West End, known for her dramatic flair both on and off the stage. Now retired in a quiet coastal town, she still commands attention in every room she enters. Fond of her sherry and old theatre gossip, she sometimes blurs the line between truth and performance. Her memory is sharp, but her stories often contradict one another—intentionally or not.",
